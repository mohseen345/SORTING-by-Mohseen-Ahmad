    "To find the element that appears the maximum number of times in an array of \\( n \\) numbers, we can use a straightforward approach using a hash map (or dictionary in Python) to count occurrences of each element. Here's a step-by-step algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize a dictionary:** This will be used to store elements of the array as keys and their respective counts as values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterate through the array:** For each element in the array:\n",
    "   - If the element is not already in the dictionary, add it with an initial count of 1.\n",
    "   - If the element is already in the dictionary, increment its count by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Find the element with maximum count:** Traverse through the dictionary to find the key (element) with the maximum value (count).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output:** Return the element with the maximum co\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 1:** We initialize a dictionary `count_map` to store the counts of each element.\n",
    "- **Step 2:** We iterate through the array `arr`. For each element `num`, we check if it exists in `count_map`. If it does, we increment its count; otherwise, we add it with an initial count of 1.\n",
    "- **Step 3:** After populating `count_map` with all elements and their counts, we traverse through the dictionary to find the key (element) with the maximum value (count).\n",
    "- **Step 4:** We return the element with the maximum count as the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** \\( O(n) \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of elements in the array. This is because we iterate through the array once to populate the dictionary and then iterate through the dictionary to find the maximum count.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** \\( O(n) \\) in the worst case, where all elements are unique and thus stored in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm efficiently finds the element that appears the maximum number of times in the array using hashing to maintain counts, ensuring optimal performance for large arrays."
